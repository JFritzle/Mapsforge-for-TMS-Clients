- Fixed and forced utf-8 character encoding
- Fixed: For Java version >= 9, handle Java version strings with
  version number followed by optional pre-release and build information
- Fixed: Selecting render theme OSMARENDER resulted in an error message
- Fixed: Tooltip font size now follows changes in GUI font size
- Achieve script compatibility with Tcl/Tk versions 8.6, 8.7 and 9.0
- So that their indicator sizes follow changes in font size,
  checkbutton and radiobutton have been implemented as ttk widgets
- Due to ttk theme and ttk widgets, GUI design has slightly changed
  Apart from fonts, GUI appearances in Windows and Linux have been adapted as well as possible
-  Due to "direct" renderers much worse label handling at tile edges,
  Mapsforge renderer selection has been hidden and "database" renderer forced.
  To show again, find and modify "set show_renderer" line in script file
- For performance reasons, output console and tile server(s)
  are now running in separate threads
  -> Installation of Linux package tcl-thread is required!
- For tile server version 0.21.0 and newer: added Mapsforge renderer line scaling
- Several minor script improvements
- README: Note about required Linux package tcl-thread
